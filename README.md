# Project Overview

## PrimeAlpha-Automation

This project automates the testing of various functionalities of the customer module on a web application. The automation script, written using Java with Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, and ChromeDriver, tests the login process, navigation through different sections, and interaction with various elements on the page.

### Key Features

- **Automated Login and Verification**: The script automates the login process, including entering credentials, OTP verification, and navigating to the dashboard.
- **Section Navigation**: The script covers navigation through multiple sections such as AUM Flow, Product Overview, Disclaimer, Dataroom, Investment Preference, Insights & News, Products, Investors, Resources, Saved List, and more.
- **Element Interaction**: It performs various actions such as clicking buttons, editing fields, generating and sharing links, and sending messages.
- **Page Scrolling**: Uses JavaScriptExecutor to scroll through the webpage, ensuring elements are in view for interaction.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures that all major functionalities of the customer module are tested for proper behavior and user experience.

### Dependencies

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **JUnit**: For structuring and running the tests.
- **ChromeDriver**: For controlling the Chrome browser.
- **Java**: Programming language used for writing the script.

### Setup Instructions
